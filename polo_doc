Introduction

     Setup

# make sure you have curl installed

   Poloniex provides both HTTP and websocket APIs for interacting
   with the exchange. Both allow read access to public market data
   and private read access to your account. Private write access
   to your account is available via the private HTTP API.

   The public HTTP endpoint is accessed via GET requests while the
   private endpoint is accessed via HMAC-SHA512 signed POST
   requests using [393]API keys. Both types of HTTP endpoints
   return results in JSON format.

    [393] https://poloniex.com/apiKeys

   The websocket API allows push notifications about the public
   order books, lend books and your private account. Similarly to
   the HTTP API, it requires HMAC-SHA512 signed requests using
   [394]API keys for requests related to your private account.
   Please note that the legacy Private HTTP API and Websockets
   Channel (Account Notifications) have been decommissioned as of
   Feb 28th, 2023.

    [394] https://poloniex.com/apiKeys

Getting Started

Sign Up

   If you do not have a Poloniex account yet, use the button below
   to sign up.

   [395]Sign Up

    [395] https://poloniex.com/signup/

Create an API Key

   Once you are verified and have an account, you can create an
   API Key.

   Enabling IP address restrictions for API keys is strongly
   recommended. Withdrawals are disabled by default and must be
   enabled on a per key basis.

   As the name implies, your secret must remain private! If you
   suspect your key has been compromised, immediately disable that
   key and generate a new one.

Authenticate

# Find the HMAC-SHA512 signature of your POST parameters
# using your secret key. Set the nonce to the current
# milliseconds. (available with date +%s00000)
 echo -n "command=returnBalances&nonce=154264078495300" | \
openssl sha512 -hmac $API_SECRET
# You will use this signature as a header in your request.
# For example:
 curl -X POST \
     -d "command=returnBalances&nonce=154264078495300" \
     -H "Key: 7BCLAZQZ-HKLK9K6U-3MP1RNV9-2LS1L33J" \
     -H "Sign: 2a7849ecf...ae71161c8e9a364e21d9de9" \
     https://poloniex.com/tradingApi

   TLS 1.2 or greater is required. The public endpoint does not
   require API keys or nonces. So if you are only interested in
   the public endpoints, skip ahead [396]here.

    [396] https://docs.legacy.poloniex.com/#public-http-api-methods

   Private HTTP endpoints are authenticated using HMAC-SHA512
   signed POST request.

   Private HTTP endpoints also require a nonce, which must be an
   integer greater than the previous nonce used. There is no
   requirement that nonces increase by a specific amount, so the
   current epoch time in milliseconds is an easy choice. As each
   API key has its own nonce tracking, using a different key for
   each client process can greatly simplify nonce management.

Minimize Latency

   If you will be performing high-frequency trading, you may wish
   to locate your bots as close to our servers as possible. As
   Poloniex uses Cloudflare for all requests, you can minimize
   network latency by positioning your client near the Cloudflare
   gateway in Dublin, Ireland. You can identify which Cloudflare
   gateway your client is accessing by running this command on the
   same machine as your bot:

   curl -s https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace

   Cloudflare’s Dublin data center will return a “colo” field of
   “DUB”. If you get a different “colo” value, you can look up the
   location at [397]https://www.cloudflarestatus.com.

    [397] https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/

HTTP API

   Please note that the Private HTTP API endpoints have been
   decommissioned as of Feb 28th, 2023.

   The HTTP API allows read access to public market data through
   the public endpoint and read / write access to your private
   account via the private endpoint.
     * Public HTTP Endpoint: https://poloniex.com/public
     * [DEL: Private HTTP Endpoint:
       https://poloniex.com/tradingApi :DEL]

   Please note that there is a default limit of 6 calls per
   second. If you require more than this, please consider
   optimizing your application using the websocket-based push API,
   the "moveOrder" command, or the "all" parameter where
   appropriate.

   Making more than 6 calls per second to the API, or repeatedly
   and needlessly fetching excessive amounts of data, can result
   in rate limit. Please be careful.
   If your account's volume is over $5 million in 30 day volume,
   you may be eligible for an API rate limit increase. Please
   email api-support@poloniex.com.

   While the adapter aims to mimic existing error messages, there
   maybe instances where native NTS messages maybe sent back. For
   a list of NTS error messages and description, refer to his
   [398]page.

    [398] https://docs.poloniex.com/#error-codes

Public HTTP API Methods

   The public HTTP API allows read access to public market data.
   Public HTTP URL: `https://poloniex.com/public`

   There are seven public methods, all of which take HTTP GET
   requests and return output in JSON format. No authentication is
   necessary but you must not excessively use any API endpoint.

[DEL: Private HTTP API Methods :DEL]

   The private HTTP API allows read / write access to your private
   account.
   [DEL: Private HTTP URL: `https://poloniex.com/tradingApi` :DEL]
   Please note that the Private HTTP API has been decommissioned
   as of Feb 28th, 2023.

   All calls to the trading API are sent via HTTP using POST
   parameters to https://poloniex.com/tradingApi and must contain
   the following headers:
     * Key - Your API key.
     * Sign - The query's POST data signed by your key's "secret"
       according to the HMAC-SHA512 method.

   Additionally, all queries must include a "nonce" or "timestamp"
   POST parameter.

   The nonce parameter is an integer which must always be greater
   than the previous nonce used and does not need to increase by
   one. Using the epoch in milliseconds is an easy choice here but
   be careful about time synchronization if using the same API key
   across multiple servers.

   The timestamp parameter is an integer corresponding to the
   epoch in seconds. The timestamp parameter is valid for +/- 5
   seconds.

   All responses from the trading API are in JSON format. In the
   event of an error, the response will always be of the following
   format:

   { "error": "<error message>" }

   When placing orders there are currently the following minimum
   order sizes according to the quote currency.
     Quote   Minimum Total Order
   BTC       0.0001
   ETH       0.0001
   USD (any) 1
   TRX       100
   BNB       0.06

   There are several methods accepted by the trading API, each of
   which is specified by the "command" POST parameter:

returnBalances

# Note: set the nonce to the current milliseconds. For example: date +%s
00000
echo -n "command=returnBalances&nonce=154264078495300" | \

   Returns the status of a given order, specified by the
   "orderNumber" POST parameter. If the specified orderNumber is
   not open, or it is not yours, you will receive an error.

   Note that returnOrderStatus, in concert with returnOrderTrades,
   can be used to determine various status information about an
   order:
     * If returnOrderStatus returns status: "Open", the order is
       fully open.
     * If returnOrderStatus returns status: "Partially filled",
       the order is partially filled, and returnOrderTrades may be
       used to find the list of those fills.
     * If returnOrderStatus returns an error and returnOrderTrades
       returns an error, then the order was cancelled before it
       was filled.
     * If returnOrderStatus returns an error and returnOrderTrades
       returns a list of trades, then the order had fills and is
       no longer open (due to being completely filled, or
       partially filled and then cancelled).

Input Fields

      Field                 Description
   orderNumber The identifier of the order to return.

   Places a limit buy order in a given market. Required POST
   parameters are "currencyPair", "rate", and "amount". If
   successful, the method will return the order number.

   You may optionally set "fillOrKill", "immediateOrCancel",
   "postOnly" to 1. A fill-or-kill order will either fill in its
   entirety or be completely aborted. An immediate-or-cancel order
   can be partially or completely filled, but any portion of the
   order that cannot be filled immediately will be canceled rather
   than left on the order book. A post-only order will only be
   placed if no portion of it fills immediately; this guarantees
   you will never pay the taker fee on any part of the order that
   fills.

   Immediately places a withdrawal for a given currency, with no
   email confirmation. In order to use this method, withdrawal
   privilege must be enabled for your API key. Required POST
   parameters are "currency", "amount", and "address".

   For withdrawals which support payment IDs, (such as XMR) you
   may optionally specify a "paymentId" parameter.

   For currencies where there are multiple networks to choose from
   (like USDT or BTC), you can specify the chain by setting the
   "currency" parameter to be a multiChain currency name, like
   USDTTRON, USDTETH, or BTCTRON. You can get information on these
   currencies, like fees or if they"re disabled, by [403]adding
   the "includeMultiChainCurrencies" optional parameter to the
   returnCurrencies endpoint. The previous method of choosing a
   network using the optional "currencyToWithdrawAs" parameter
   will continue to function as it used to, but is no longer
   recommended.

Websocket API

# Install your favorite websocket command line tool.
# Our examples use https://github.com/hashrocket/ws
# which can be installed with this command:

go get -u github.com/hashrocket/ws

   Websockets can be read by any standard websocket library. Data
   is organized into channels to which an API client may
   subscribe.
   Websocket URL: `wss://api2.poloniex.com` Please note that the
   Account Notifications Channel has been decommissioned as of Feb
   28th, 2023.

   While the adapter aims to mimic existing error messages, there
   maybe instances where native NTS messages maybe sent back. For
   a list of NTS error messages and description, refer to his

Requests and Responses

   There are two type of requests supported; subscribe and
   unsubscribe. The requests are for a specific channel. For
   non-book requests, the first response is always an
   acknowledgement of the request. All channel updates are of the
   following format

   [<channel>, <sequence id>, <update data...>]

   <sequence id> is a number increasing by one with each update
   and is unique within its channel. The sequence-id is always
   null for non-book channels.

Subscribing and Unsubscribing

# Public channels
ws wss://api2.poloniex.com
> {"command": "subscribe", "channel": 1002}

# Private channels
# Note: set the nonce to the current milliseconds. For example: date +%s
00000
echo -n "nonce=154264078495300" | openssl sha512 -hmac $API_SECRET
ws wss://api2.poloniex.com
> {"command": "subscribe", "channel": 1000, "sign": "e832d65f...8a522df8
", "key": "7BCLAZQZ-HKLK9K6U-3MP1RNV9-2LS1L33J", "payload": "nonce=15426
4078495300"}

   To receive updates from a channel you must subscribe to it. To
   subscribe to a public channel (all except the account
   notifications channel), determine its channel ID (provided with
   the description of each channel, and summarized here), send a
   JSON message in the following format:

   { "command": "subscribe", "channel": "<channel id>" }

   To subscribe to a private channel, the parameters described in
   the authentication section are required in the subscription
   message. Just like the trading API, an integer nonce must be
   chosen that is greater than the previous nonce used; for this
   purpose the current epoch time in milliseconds is a reasonable
   choice. As each API key has its own nonce tracking, using a
   different key for each client process can greatly simplify
   nonce management. If the chosen nonce is 1234, provide a
   "payload" parameter consisting of nonce=1234, a "key" parameter
   with your API key, and a "sign" parameter with the HMAC-SHA512
   signature of the payload signed by your secret:

   { "command": "subscribe", "channel": "<channel id>", "key":
   "<your API key>", "payload": "nonce=<epoch ms>", "sign":
   "<hmac_sha512(secret).update("nonce=<epoch ms>").hexdigest()>"
   }

   In all cases the first message will be an acknowledgement of
   the subscription:

   [<channel id>, 1]

   To unsubscribe, send an unsubscribe message with the channel
   ID:

   { "command": "unsubscribe", "channel": <channel id> }

   You can subscribe and unsubscribe to multiple channels at the
   same time using the following format:

   { "command": "subscribe", "channel": "<channel id>,<channel
   id>,...<channel id>" }

   { "command": "unsubscribe", "channel": "<channel id>,<channel
   id>,...<channel id>" }

   You will receive an acknowledgement for each channel. If one of
   the channels you are subscribing to is a private channel, the
   authentication parameters are required.

Channel Descriptions

   The following <channel ids> are supported:
       Channel      Type               Name

   Please note that this channel has been decommissioned as of Feb
   28th, 2023. Notice: Before using this channel, please be aware
   that it is a beta feature. We will not make breaking API
   changes, but we may undertake changes such as adding extra data
   fields to the ends of arrays, or adding new message types. Your
   code should be tolerant of this. We have made all reasonable
   efforts to ensure its correctness, but you use this channel at
   your own risk during the beta phase.

   The account notifications channel (id 1000) provides real-time
   updates of trade and balance changes on your account. You can
   (and should) use it to track your account's trading activity
   (instead of relying on repeated calls to the trading API). It
   is an authenticated websocket endpoint, so subscribing to it
   requires the parameters discussed in the subscribing section:

   { "command": "subscribe", "channel": "1000", "key": "<your API
   key>", "payload": "nonce=<epoch ms>", "sign":
   "<hmac_sha512(secret).update("nonce=<epoch ms>").hexdigest()>"
   }

   The first message is acknowledgement of the subscription.

   [1000, 1]

   Subsequent messages represent updates to your account. In
   general, a message consists of a combination of updates of
   different types. Each update is an array of data, where the
   first element is a character denoting the type of the update,
   and subsequent elements are various parameters:

   [ 1000, null, [ ["b", DATA_1, DATA_2, DATA_3, DATA_4], ["n",
   DATA_1, DATA_2, DATA_3, DATA_4, DATA_5, DATA_6] ] ]

   A given message may contain multiple updates, multiple types of
   updates, and multiple updates of the same type. There is no
   ordering guarantee of update types within a single message.
   Effectively, each message is a record of all of the changes to
   your account induced by a single action. There are four types
   of updates, as described below:
     * p messages represent an acknowledgement that an order is
       pending. They are in the format ["p", <order number>,
       <currency pair id>, "<rate>", "<amount>", "<order type>",
       "<clientOrderId>", "<epoch_ms>"]. Currency pair IDs may be
       found in the reference table. The order type is either 0 or
       1 (sell or buy).
     * b updates represent an available balance update. They are
       in the format ["b", <currency id>, "<wallet>", "<amount>",
       "<balance>"]. Currency IDs may be found in the reference
       table, or using the returnCurrencies REST call. The wallet
       can be e (exchange), m (margin), or l (lending). Thus, a b
       update representing a deduction of 0.06 BTC from the
       exchange wallet, with an ending balance of 0.94 BTC, will
       look like ["b", 28, "e", "-0.06000000", "0.94000000"].
     * n updates represent a newly created limit order. They are
       in the format ["n", <currency pair id>, <order number>,
       <order type>, "<rate>", "<amount>", "<date>", "<original
       amount ordered>" "<clientOrderId>"]. Currency pair IDs are
       described here, the order type can either be 0 (sell) or 1
       (buy), the date is formatted according to the format string
       Y-m-d H:i:s and clientOrderId will be a string if present
       or null. Thus, an n update representing a complete unfilled
       buy order for 2 ETH at rate 0.03 BTC per ETH with a
       clientOrderId of 12345 will look like ["n", 148, 6083059,
       1, "0.03000000", "2.00000000", "2018-09-08 04:54:09",
       "2.00000000", "12345"].
     * o updates represent an order update. They are in the format
       ["o", <order number>, "<new amount>", "<order type>",
       "<clientOrderId>"] and order type is one of: f, s, or c,
       corresponding to a fill, self-trade, or cancelled order,
       respectively. Canceled orders have an additional field
       "<canceledAmount>" and are therefore in the format ["o",
       <order number>, "<new amount>", "c", "<clientOrderId>",
       "<canceledAmount>"] Self-trade and partially-filled orders
       have an additional field "<totalAmount>". and are therefore
       in the format ["o", <order number>, "<new amount>",
       "s"|"f", "<clientOrderId>", "<totalAmount>"].
     * m updates represent an margin position update. They are in
       the format ["m", <order number>, "<currency>", "<amount>",
       "<clientOrderId>"]. Currency IDs may be found in the
       reference table, or using the returnCurrencies REST call.
       ClientOrderId will be a string if present or null. Thus, a
       m update representing a deduction of 0.06 BTC from a margin
       position will look like this ["m", 23432933, 28,
       "-0.06000000", "null"].

   Order type    Amount           Interpretation
   f          > 0.00000000 partially filled order
   f          = 0.00000000 completely filled order
   c          > 0.00000000 partially cancelled order
   c          = 0.00000000 completely cancelled order
   s          > 0.00000000 partially filled self-trade
   s          = 0.00000000 completely filled self-trade

   Thus, an o update representing a partially filled limit order
   with a new amount of 1.5 and a clientOrderId of 12345 will look
   like: ["o", 6083059, "1.50000000", "f", "12345"].
     * t updates represent a trade notification. They are in the
       format ["t", <trade ID>, "<rate>", "<amount>", "<fee
       multiplier>", <funding type>, <order number>, <total fee>,
       <date>, "<clientOrderId>", "<trade total>", "<epoch_ms>"].
       The fee multiplier is the fee schedule applied to the trade
       (for instance, if a trade had a trading fee of 0.25%, the
       fee multiplier will be '0.00250000'). The funding type
       represents the funding used for the trade, and may be 0
       (exchange wallet), 1 (borrowed funds), 2 (margin funds), or
       3 (lending funds). Note that while the trade ID will always
       be distinct, the order number may be shared across multiple
       t updates if multiple trades were required to fill a limit
       order. The total fee is (amount * rate) * fee multiplier.
       The date is formatted according to the format string Y-m-d
       H:i:s and clientOrder will be a string if present or null.
       Trade total is the amount if the user has sold or (amount *
       rate) if the user has bought. A t update representing a
       purchase of 0.5 ETH at rate 0.03 BTC per ETH using exchange
       funds with a fee schedule of 0.25% and a clientOrderId of
       12345 will look like: ["t", 12345, "0.03000000",
       "0.50000000", "0.00250000", 0, 6083059, "0.00000375",
       "2018-09-08 05:54:09", "12345", "0.015", "1522877119341"]
     * k updates represent an update indicating an API order has
       been killed, due to specified constraints not being
       matched. A postOnly or fillOrKill order that doesn't
       successfully execute will generate a k message. k messages
       are in the format ["k", <order number>, "<clientOrderId>"].

   As mentioned above, a single logical action may cause a message
   with multiple updates. For instance, placing a limit order to
   buy ETH using BTC, which is immediately partially fulfilled,
   will cause an update with 5 parts: a p message with the newly
   placed pending order for the BTC_ETH market, a b update with a
   positive ETH balance (the ETH that was immediately bought), a b
   update with a negative BTC balance update (the BTC removed from
   the user's funds to pay for the ETH), a t update representing
   the trade in which the order was partially fulfilled and then
   the remaining amount becomes open, and an n update with the new
   limit order for the rest of the requested ETH.

   Note that many actions do not have explicit notification types,
   but rather are represented by the underlying trade and balance
   changes:
     * Stop-limit orders immediately cause a b notification (that
       the appropriate balance has been decremented to reserve an
       asset for the limit order). When they are triggered they
       cause notifications commensurate with a standard limit
       order being placed (n or t updates depending on whether the
       limit was immediately fulfilled).
     * Margin liquidations cause a notification with t updates for
       whatever trades were performed during the liquidation, and
       b updates for the m (margin) wallet balance changes.
     * Accepted loan offers cause a notification with b updates
       for the resulting l (lending) wallet balance changes.
     * Self-trades generate o updates. This is because in a
       self-trade, the trader is both the maker AND the taker, and
       receives relevant messages for both parties.

   There are currently no notifications of transfers between
   wallets initiated via the transfers page or the transferBalance
   trading API call.

   Subscribe to price aggregated depth of book by [417]currency
   pair. Response includes an initial book snapshot, book
   modifications, and trades. Book modification updates with 0
   quantity should be treated as removal of the price level. Note
   that the updates are price aggregated and do not contain
   individual orders.

   Subscription example for BTC_BTS pair (id is 14). You can
   either subscribe using the currency pair ID or name. Currency
   pair IDs are listed in the [418]currency pair ID list.

   { "command":"subscribe", "channel": 14 }

   Or

   { "command": "subscribe", "channel": "BTC_BTS" }

   The first response is the initial dump of the book. NOTE: An
   "i" message can occur after the initial subscription under
   certain circumstances. When this occurs the client is required
   to reset the state of the price aggregated book.

   [ <channel id>, <sequence number>, [ [ "i", { "currencyPair":
   "<currency pair name>", "orderBook": [ { "<lowest ask price>":
   "<lowest ask size>", "<next ask price>": "<next ask size>", ...
   }, { "<highest bid price>": "<highest bid size>", "<next bid
   price>": "<next bid size>", ... } ] }, "<epoch_ms>" ] ] ]

   For example:

   [ 14, 8767, [ [ "i", { "currencyPair": "BTC_BTS", "orderBook":
   [ { "0.00001853": "2537.5637", "0.00001854": "1567238.172367"
   }, { "0.00001841": "3645.3647", "0.00001840": "1637.3647" } ]
   }, "1522877119341"] ] ]

   Subsequent responses are updates to the book and trades

   [ <channel id>, <sequence number>, [ ["o", <1 for bid 0 for
   ask>, "<price>", "<size>", "<epoch_ms>"], ["o", <1 for bid 0
   for ask>, "<price>", "<size>", "<epoch_ms>"], ["t", "<trade
   id>", <1 for buy 0 for sell>, "<price>", "<size>", <timestamp>,
   "<epoch_ms>"] ] ... ]

   For example

   [ 14, 8768, [ ["o", 1, "0.00001823", "5534.6474",
   "1522877119341"], ["o", 0, "0.00001824",
   "6575.464","1522877119341"], ["t", "42706057", 1, "0.05567134",
   "0.00181421", 1522877119, "1522877119341"] ] ]
